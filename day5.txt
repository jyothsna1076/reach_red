well, today ,i actually didnt remember the number of problems i solved, becasue todays high light is something different----OA OF DESHAW COMPANY

So, there were 3 questions, i was able to solve one question all by myself 2nd question , got the idea but wasnt able to code it, third, time was not sufficient to even think clearly about it.

yess, may be this is not great, but i know that i levelled up , will complete the remaining questions by myself now
